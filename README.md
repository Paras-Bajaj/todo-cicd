End-to-End CI/CD Pipeline for Static Web Application
📋 Project Overview
This project demonstrates the design and implementation of a complete Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline for a static web application. The pipeline automates the entire software delivery lifecycle from code commit to production deployment using modern DevOps tools and practice.

🎯 Key Features
Full Automation: End-to-end workflow from code commit to deployment

Quality Gates: Integrated static code analysis with SonarQube

Containerization: Docker-based deployment with security best practices

Consistency: Identical environments across development and production

Security: Non-root container execution and vulnerability scanning

🚀 Pipeline Architecture
Workflow Stages
Code Commit → Developer pushes to GitHub

Trigger → GitHub webhook notifies Jenkins

Build → Maven validates and packages

Quality Check → SonarQube static analysis

Containerize → Docker image creation

Deploy → Application deployment to runtime

Visual Pipeline Flow

Developer → GitHub → Jenkins → Maven → SonarQube → Docker → Deployment
⚙️ Installation & Setup
Prerequisites
Windows 10/11 with WSL2 enabled

Docker Desktop for Windows

Git for Windows

OpenJDK 11

Apache Maven

Step-by-Step Setup
1. Install Docker Desktop
powershell
# Download from: https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop
# Enable WSL 2 backend for better performance
2. Install Required Software
powershell
choco install git openjdk11 maven -y
3. Set Up Jenkins in Docker
powershell
# Create Jenkins data directory
mkdir C:\JenkinsData\jenkins_home

# Run Jenkins container
docker run -d `
  --name jenkins-cicd `
  --restart unless-stopped `
  -p 8080:8080 `
  -p 50000:50000 `
  -v C:\JenkinsData\jenkins_home:/var/jenkins_home `
  -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock `
  jenkins/jenkins:lts-jdk11

# Get initial admin password
docker exec jenkins-cicd cat /var/jenkins_home/secrets/initialAdminPassword
4. Configure GitHub Webhook
Go to GitHub repository → Settings → Webhooks

Add webhook with URL: http://your-jenkins-server:8080/github-webhook/

Content type: application/json

Select events: Just the push event

5. Install Jenkins Plugins
Git Plugin

GitHub Plugin

Pipeline Plugin

Docker Pipeline Plugin

SonarQube Scanner Plugin

Blue Ocean Plugin

🎯 Key Achievements
Automated Triggering: GitHub webhooks automatically initiate pipeline

Quality Enforcement: SonarQube gates prevent deployment of substandard code

Security Best Practices: Non-root user execution in Docker containers

Consistent Environments: Docker ensures identical runtime across stages

Complete Automation: Zero manual intervention from code commit to deployment

🔮 Future Scope
Automated Testing: Integration of unit, integration, and UI testing

Multi-Environment Deployment: Staging and production environments

Cloud Deployment: AWS S3, Azure Static Web Apps, or Kubernetes

Infrastructure as Code: Terraform or CloudFormation integration

Enhanced Security: Trivy/Clair for vulnerability scanning

Monitoring & Observability: Prometheus, Grafana, ELK stack integration

GitOps Implementation: ArgoCD or Flux for declarative deployments

⚠️ Limitations & Challenges
Complexity Overhead: Multiple tools add maintenance burden for simple applications

Integration Challenges: Heterogeneous tool configuration complexities

Feedback Loop Delays: 10-15 minute pipeline execution time

Limited Testing: Basic static analysis without comprehensive web testing

Single Environment: No staging or canary deployment capabilities

Steep Learning Curve: Multiple technologies require significant learning time
